    <h1>YOU – Development Info</h1>
    <div class="dev-highlight">
      YOU is more than just a website – it’s our vision of creating a <b>digital space that feels alive, personal, and exciting</b>. Inspired by the smooth, playful interface of the Nintendo Switch, our aim was to make YOU interactive and fun, while practical and easy to use. Built for DynamiX 2025, it’s also about pushing our <b>creativity and skills</b> to build something truly unique.
    </div>
    <h2>The Team</h2>
    <div class="dev-team">
      <ul>
        <li><b>Tanuj Sharma</b>: Concept lead, design, and main development</li>
        <li><b>Sparsh Jain</b>: Core development and testing</li>
      </ul>
      Together, we experimented with layouts, colors, and playful CSS to create a website that feels modern—from animated backgrounds to swipable app icons and an interactive dock.
    </div>
    <h2>Technology</h2>
    <div class="tech-stack">
      <ul>
        <li><b>Frontend:</b> HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript</li>

    <h2>Design Philosophy</h2>
    <div class="dev-highlight">
      <b>Playful, but smart.</b> Every click, swipe, and animation invites exploration and smooth interaction.
      <br><br>
      We tackled challenges like audio/video playback, true cross-device UI, and natural-feeling features, learning and improving with each hurdle.
